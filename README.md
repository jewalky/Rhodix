Some PoC Unity code that *kind of* reads Radix: Beyond the Void resources and levels

Known bugs: due to shitty format of Radix levels (sector over sector is very common for destructible geometry it seems) there are Z-buffer issues.
Maybe Radix has some flags or whatever to fix this. In which case it's a todo.
